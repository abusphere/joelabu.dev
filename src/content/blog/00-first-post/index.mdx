## Welcome

Welcome to my blog. We'll see how populated it actually gets.

For now, a brief *about me*:

My name is Joel Abu. I'm currently a first-year undergraduate student at MIT. As of now, my intention is to study electrical engineering (course 6-5) and am broadly interested in robotics (and am especially intrigued by the recent developments in robot learning).
